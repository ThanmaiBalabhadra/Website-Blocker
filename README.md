

This project directly modifies the system's `hosts` file to block specific websites during defined working hours. Since it interacts with the operating system, it's not suitable for live hosting like typical web apps. However, you can share this project using these methods:

### 🧾 1. Host the Code on GitHub

1. Create a GitHub repository.
2. Upload the files: `website_blocker.py`, `website_blocker.pyw`, and `README.md`.
3. Push it to GitHub.

🔗 Example: https://github.com/your-username/website-blocker-application

### 💡 2. Demonstrate UI or Functionality Using Replit (Optional)

If you want to simulate this on Replit:
- Create a new Replit project (Python).
- Upload your `website_blocker.py`.
- Remove or modify the file paths to avoid system-level changes.
- Simulate the blocking logic using `print()` statements.

📝 Note: Replit won’t allow editing `hosts` file.

### ⚠️ Important Notes:
- **Admin rights** are required to edit the `hosts` file on your system.
- Run the script locally using:
  ```bash
  python website_blocker.py
